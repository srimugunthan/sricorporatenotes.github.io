Domino of resignations
========================

A **domino effect of resignations** (also called a **"turnover contagion"**) occurs when one employee's departure triggers a chain reaction of others leaving. This is especially common in high-stress environments like tech, consulting, or startups. Here’s why it happens and how it spreads:

* * *

### **1\. Psychological Triggers**

*   **Social Proof:** Humans subconsciously mimic peers. When a respected colleague quits, others think: _"If they’re leaving, maybe I should too."_
    
*   **Normalization of Leaving:** Resignations break the "taboo" of quitting, making it feel safer for others to follow.
    
*   **Fear of Being "Left Behind":** Employees worry about increased workload or losing allies, prompting preemptive exits.
    

* * *

### **2\. Workplace Conditions That Fuel the Domino Effect**

*   **Poor Leadership:**
    
    *   Toxic managers, lack of recognition, or broken promises demoralize teams.
        
    *   Example: _"If Sarah quit because our boss ignored her, I’m next."_
        
*   **Unfair Workloads:**
    
    *   Resignations redistribute work unfairly, pushing others to their limits.
        
*   **Loss of Trust:**
    
    *   If leadership mishandles one exit (e.g., no backfill), others lose confidence.
        
*   **Silent Discontent:**
    
    *   Many employees privately share frustrations—one resignation emboldens them to act.
        

* * *

### **3\. How the Domino Effect Spreads**

*   **The First Resignation:** Often a high performer or influencer. Their exit signals:
    
    *   _"Things won’t improve here."_
        
    *   _"Better opportunities exist elsewhere."_
        
*   **The Ripple Effect:**
    
    1.  Remaining employees absorb extra work → burnout → more resignations.
        
    2.  Exit interviews reveal systemic issues → others realize they’re not alone.
        
    3.  New hires notice turnover and question stability.
        

* * *

### **4\. Industries Prone to Domino Resignations**

*   **Tech:** Fast-paced, competitive job market.
    
*   **Consulting:** High stress, "up-or-out" cultures.
    
*   **Startups:** Uncertainty + emotional investment in colleagues.
    

* * *

### **5\. How to Prevent It**

*   **Act Fast After the First Resignation:**
    
    *   Address the root cause (e.g., manager conflict, burnout).
        
    *   **Example:** If someone left due to lack of growth, announce a promotion path.
        
*   **Retain Key Influencers:**
    
    *   Identify and reassure informal leaders (they shape team morale).
        
*   **Transparent Communication:**
    
    *   _"We know departures are tough. Here’s how we’ll rebalance work and hire."_
        
*   **Monitor Sentiment:**
    
    *   Pulse surveys, 1:1s to catch discontent early.
        

* * *

### **Real-World Example**

A **FAANG engineer** quits due to return-to-office mandates → teammates see them thriving remotely elsewhere → 3 more resign within weeks → leadership scrambles to adjust policies (too late).

* * *

### **Key Takeaway**

Domino resignations aren’t about money—they’re about **culture, trust, and perceived fairness**. Once the chain starts, it’s hard to stop unless leadership intervenes decisively.

**Ask yourself:**

*   Is my team’s attrition clustered around a specific issue (e.g., manager, project)?
    
*   Are high performers leaving first? (A major red flag.)
