# without being a manager, how do you wield a lot of informal influence and power in the organisation? Include some advice from HBR articles for the below.

(1) Look at Reddit, Quora, and other forums for examples of how people have built informal authority. Find articles and guides on how to build influence without formal authority.
(3) Find articles on network power and how one can position themselves in the organizational network to hold power.
(4) Find articles on specific branding and self-promotion activities that have been used to gather authority.
(5) Find information on how one chooses a field of expertise to become valuable. For example , someone who knows the numbers of business or someone with deep customer expertise
(6) Find information on how one moves into high-impact projects. What strategies people use to navigate to high impact projects.
(7) Find information on how to build strong relationships with colleagues and stakeholders, and also give examples of preferred communication styles used by such influencers.
(8) For each of the formal authority powers that a manager possesses, give an equivalent counter-weight that a highly influential individual contributor can have. For example, a manager has authority over what projects their reportee individual contributor will work on. But if the individual contributor is not happy with the project, they can use their network to migrate to another project with more impact. Include a list of  some ten items for this

In contemporary organizational structures, formal authority often represents only one dimension of power. The ability to wield informal influence has emerged as a critical competency for individual contributors seeking to drive change, secure high-impact opportunities, and shape organizational outcomes without managerial titles. This report synthesizes insights from academic research, industry case studies, and practitioner forums to map the multidimensional strategies for building and exercising informal power. Drawing on examples from platforms like Reddit and Quora, analyses of network dynamics from Deloitte, and frameworks from Harvard Business Review, we explore how professionals can position themselves as indispensable nodes in organizational ecosystems through deliberate personal branding, strategic relationship-building, and mastery of invisible organizational architectures.

## The Foundations of Informal Leadership

### Defining the Landscape of Influence

Informal leadership operates through **relational capital** rather than hierarchical position, enabling individuals to mobilize resources, shape decisions, and direct collective action through persuasion and social proof[^1][^3]. Unlike formal managers who rely on positional authority, informal leaders cultivate power through:

- **Expertise recognition**: Becoming the go-to resource in critical domains
- **Network centrality**: Occupying brokerage positions in information flows
- **Social credibility**: Earning peer endorsement through consistent value delivery

The Reddit case study reveals both opportunities and risks—while some organizations misuse "informal leadership" to extract unpaid managerial labor, others successfully identify emerging leaders through peer nominations like "Jen was telling me about this, I want to join"[^1]. This dichotomy underscores the importance of intentional strategy in informal influence cultivation.

## Strategic Positioning in Organizational Networks

### Mapping Power Through Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)

Deloitte's research demonstrates that formal org charts often misrepresent actual influence networks[^4]. Individual contributors can leverage ONA principles to:

1. **Identify betweenness centrality opportunities**: Position yourself as the bridge between disconnected groups
2. **Analyze communication patterns**: Recognize which colleagues control critical information flows
3. **Develop structural hole strategies**: Become the sole connector between departmental silos

A Quora engineer exemplified this by accessing cross-functional teams to understand company-wide strategy, enabling identification of high-leverage projects[^2]. This network-aware approach transforms individual contributors into **information brokers** who control the pace and direction of organizational knowledge.

## Cultivating Expert Authority

### Selecting Strategic Domains of Mastery

The Indeed career framework emphasizes aligning skills with organizational needs[^6]. Effective practitioners:

- **Conduct gap analyses**: Identify undersupplied competencies through stakeholder interviews
- **Build T-shaped expertise**: Develop breadth across multiple domains with depth in one specialty
- **Create verification mechanisms**: Publish internal wikis, host brown-bag sessions, or develop diagnostic tools

Harvard Business Review's guidance on developing "expert power" suggests attending conferences and leading professional community initiatives to cement subject-matter authority[^3]. A promotional model's personal branding strategy—showcasing specialized skills through curated portfolios—translates effectively to corporate environments when adapted for internal audiences[^5].

---

## Navigating to High-Impact Projects

### Six Strategies for Opportunity Capture

High Impact Projects research identifies methods for securing mission-critical assignments[^7]:

1. **Volunteer for cross-functional SWAT teams**
2. **Develop alliance-building skills to bridge departmental divides**
3. **Create visibility through pre-mortem analyses of upcoming initiatives**
4. **Position as the "glue" connecting technical and business units**
5. **Pilot experimental solutions to chronic operational pain points**
6. **Document and share project learnings through internal channels**

The Quora case study demonstrates this through engineers accessing leadership strategies and performance rubrics to identify growth opportunities[^2]. By combining network positioning with demonstrated competence, individual contributors can become the **default choice** for high-stakes initiatives.

---

## Relationship Architecture and Communication Mastery

### Building Influence Through Social Capital

HBR's influence framework emphasizes cultivating personal connections to establish presumption of positive intent[^3]. Effective practitioners:

- **Implement a 10/20/70 relationship investment model**:
    - 10% with executives (visibility)
    - 20% with cross-functional peers (collaboration)
    - 70% with immediate colleagues (executional support)
- **Adapt communication styles**:
    - **For executives**: Data-driven, strategic alignment focus
    - **For peers**: Collaborative language emphasizing mutual benefit
    - **For junior staff**: Mentorship tone fostering psychological safety

Reddit examples highlight the power of peer testimonials—colleagues spontaneously referencing an individual's contributions ("Sarah showed me how") signal established influence[^1]. Quora's documentation culture further enables influence through institutionalized knowledge sharing[^2].

## Counterbalancing Formal Authority: The Informal Power Matrix

| Formal Manager Authority | Informal Contributor Counterweight | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Project Assignment | Network-driven lateral mobility | [^1][^4][^7] |
| Performance Evaluation | Peer endorsement through 360° influence | [^1][^2][^3] |
| Budget Control | Coalition-building for resource pooling | [^4][^7] |
| Meeting Facilitation | Agenda-shaping through pre-meeting consensus | [^3][^4] |
| Promotion Recommendations | Track record of developing talent | [^2][^6] |
| Priority Setting | Framing narratives through data storytelling | [^3][^5] |
| Conflict Resolution | Social capital-based mediation | [^1][^4] |
| Information Gatekeeping | Network centrality enabling information brokering | [^4][^7] |
| Process Design | Grassroots workflow innovation adoption | [^2][^7] |
| Strategic Decision-Making | Thought leadership through white papers | [^3][^5] |

This matrix illustrates how sophisticated operators develop **counter-institutional capabilities** that neutralize formal authority advantages. For instance, while managers control official project assignments, influential contributors use network relationships to create alternative opportunities—a strategy observed in Quora's cross-team collaboration culture[^2].

## Conclusion: The New Calculus of Organizational Power

The democratization of influence in modern organizations demands a renaissance in power strategy. Individual contributors who master network geometry, expertise branding, and relational architecture can outmaneuver traditional hierarchies while avoiding the pitfalls of unofficial authority. As evidenced by Quora's documentation-driven culture and Deloitte's network analysis frameworks, the most impactful professionals combine social science insights with operational pragmatism.

Future organizational leaders must recognize that influence has become a discipline requiring continuous investment in social capital markets and personal brand equity. Those who implement these strategies position themselves not merely as employees, but as **organizational entrepreneurs** shaping enterprises from within.
