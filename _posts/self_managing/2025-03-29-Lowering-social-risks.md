### **What Is Social Risk? (And How It Stops People From Asking for Help)**

**Social risk** is the perceived danger of embarrassment, rejection, or judgment when interacting with others. It’s why people hesitate to:

*   Ask "stupid" questions.
    
*   Admit mistakes.
    
*   Seek help from someone intimidating.
    

The higher the social risk, the less likely people are to approach you—even if you’re the expert they need.

### **Examples of Social Risk in the Workplace**

#### **1\. Fear of Looking Incompetent**

*   _Example:_ A junior employee doesn’t ask how to use a tool because they think, _"I should know this already."_
    
*   **Result:** They waste hours figuring it out alone.
    

#### **2\. Fear of Wasting Someone’s Time**

*   _Example:_ A teammate avoids asking a busy manager for feedback, thinking, _"They’ll be annoyed."_
    
*   **Result:** The work goes off-track without early input.
    

#### **3\. Fear of Judgment**

*   _Example:_ Someone doesn’t admit a mistake because, _"They’ll think I’m careless."_
    
*   **Result:** The error grows into a bigger problem.
    

#### **4\. Fear of Rejection**

*   _Example:_ An introvert doesn’t pitch an idea in a meeting, thinking, _"No one will care."_
    
*   **Result:** The team misses a valuable insight.
    

#### **5\. Fear of Hierarchy**

*   _Example:_ An employee won’t ask the CEO a question because, _"They’re too important to bother."_
    
*   **Result:** Misalignment persists because no one speaks up.

### **How to Reduce Social Risk (So People Approach You)**

#### **✅ For Yourself (If You’re the One Hesitating):**

*   Reframe thoughts: _"Asking early saves time—smart people double-check."_
    
*   Start small: Ask low-stakes questions first to build confidence.
*   "what is the worst that could happen" mindset shift
    

#### **✅ For Others (If You Want to Be More Approachable):**

1.  **Normalize Questions**
    
    *   Say: _"I always ask about this—it’s confusing at first."_
        
2.  **Praise the Ask**
    
    *   _"Great question—I wondered the same thing when I started."_
        
3.  **Admit Your Own Gaps**
    
    *   _"I had to look this up last week—let me show you."_
        
4.  **Make It Safe to Fail**
    
    *   _"Mistakes happen—what matters is how we fix them."_

### **Why This Matters**

Lowering social risk = **more collaboration, faster learning, and fewer avoidable errors**. The most influential people don’t just _have_ answers—they make it **easy for others to ask**.
