Where do Individual contributors end their career
=================================================

Normal scope for each level as an Individual contributor is as follows:
| Level | L# | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry-Level | L3 | Task |
| Mid-Level | L4 | Feature |
| Senior | L5 | Project |
| Staff | L6 | Product / System |
| Senior Staff | L7 | Product Group / Org |
| Principal | L8 | Company |
| Distinguished | L9 | Industry |

Here's a rough estimate of the percentage of people at each level after a 20-year career, assuming a pyramid-shaped distribution where higher levels are increasingly rare:

*   **L5 (Senior)**: ~30-40%  
    Many professionals plateau at this level, as it represents a strong individual contributor or team lead role.
    
*   **L6 (Staff)**: ~20-30%  
    This level requires broader impact and leadership, which fewer achieve.
    
*   **L7 (Senior Staff)**: ~10-15%  
    Significant influence across projects or orgs is needed, making this rarer.
    
*   **L8 (Principal)**: ~5-10%  
    Very few reach this level, as it demands industry-level expertise or org-wide leadership.
    
*   **L9 (Distinguished)**: ~1-3%  
    Extremely rare, reserved for those shaping the company or industry.
    

### Notes:

1.  **Assumptions**:
    
    *   The distribution assumes a healthy attrition rate (e.g., not everyone stays 20 years).
        
    *   Company growth and industry (e.g., tech vs. finance) can skew percentages.
        
    *   Some companies "cap" levels (e.g., L6 is the terminal level for many).
        
2.  **Scope Alignment**:
    
    *   Higher levels (L7+) align with "Product Group/Org" or "Company" scope in the image, implying fewer roles exist.

Considering MAANG companies as a standard, and acknowledging that these are still **highly speculative estimates**:

*   **L9 (Distinguished):** Reaching this level after a 20-year career is exceptionally rare. This signifies a person who is a recognized leader and innovator within the broader industry. You might see **less than 1%** reaching this level.
*   **L8 (Principal):** This is still a very senior level achieved by a small percentage. These individuals have significant impact across the company. A rough estimate might be in the **1-3%** range.
*   **L7 (Senior Staff):** A larger percentage than L8 and L9, but still a minority. These individuals lead significant product groups or organizations. You might see around **5-10%** reaching this level.
*   **L6 (Staff):** A more substantial portion of long-tenured and successful individuals would likely be at this level. They are key contributors and leaders of products or systems. A rough estimate could be in the **15-25%** range.
*   **L5 (Senior):** A significant percentage of those who have stayed and progressed within the company for 20 years would likely be at this level. It represents a strong, experienced individual contributor. This could be in the **30-40% range or potentially higher**.
*   These are very rough guesses based on general industry knowledge and the typical pyramid structure of organizations. The actual percentages could vary significantly.
*   Many people who start at entry-level positions in MAANG companies may choose to specialize and remain highly effective individual contributors at levels like L5 or L6 without necessarily pursuing management or higher leadership roles.
*   Others may leave the company before 20 years for various reasons, including starting their own ventures or moving to other opportunities.

  Based on the image you've shared — which outlines IC (individual contributor) levels from L3 to L9 along with their scope — here's a rough estimate of how career progression tends to filter people across those levels by the time they have ~20 years of experience:

### Estimated Distribution After 20 Years:
| Level | Scope | Estimated % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L5 (Senior) | Project | 30% |
| L6 (Staff) | Product / System | 35% |
| L7 (Senior Staff) | Product Group / Org | 20% |
| L8 (Principal) | Company | 10% |
| L9 (Distinguished) | Industry | < 5% |


### Assumptions:

*   **L5-L6** is where most people plateau — they’re experienced, solid contributors or technical leads.
    
*   **L7** requires strong cross-functional leadership and broader org influence — fewer make it here.
    
*   **L8+** levels are rarefied, with a steep drop-off due to the scope, visibility, and influence needed.
    
*   **L9** is extremely rare — often considered equivalent to a VP or a company-wide technical visionary.
