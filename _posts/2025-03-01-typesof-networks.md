Building the right networks is crucial for personal and professional success, especially as a data scientist. Here's a breakdown of the types of networks you should consider building, tailored to your goals:   

1. Professional Network (Industry Specific):

Data Science Community:
This is your core network. Connect with fellow data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI researchers, and analysts.   
How to build it: Attend conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, KDD), workshops, meetups, and online forums (e.g., Kaggle, Reddit's r/datascience, LinkedIn groups). Contribute to open-source projects, and share your knowledge.   
Benefits: Stay updated on industry trends, learn about job opportunities, collaborate on projects, and gain mentorship.   
Domain-Specific Network:
If you specialize in a particular industry (e.g., healthcare, finance, e-commerce), build connections within that sector.
How to build it: Attend industry-specific conferences, join relevant professional organizations, and connect with people working in those fields.   
Benefits: Understand the unique challenges and opportunities in your domain, and tailor your skills to meet industry needs.   
Recruiters and Hiring Managers:
Establish relationships with recruiters specializing in data science and AI.
How to build it: Attend career fairs, connect on LinkedIn, and actively engage with recruiters' posts.
Benefits: Stay informed about job openings, get insider tips on the hiring process, and increase your chances of landing your dream job.
