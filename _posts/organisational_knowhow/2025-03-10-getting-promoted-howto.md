Here's a breakdown of how to cultivate a strong network and gain favor within your managerial structure:

**Connecting with Skip-Level Leadership:**

*   **Establish Relationships:**
    *   Go beyond your immediate manager. Build connections with skip-level or even skip-skip-level managers, especially in larger organizations.

    *   Seek advocates beyond your direct manager, such as skip-level leaders or senior cross-functional peers.
    *   External advocacy can mitigate perceived managerial bias and significantly enhance promotion prospects.
*   **Increase Visibility and Cross-Functional Collaboration:**
    *   Proactively share your work with other teams and leaders to build broader recognition.
    *   Embrace high-visibility company initiatives to accelerate career growth.

    *   Strengthen relationships by actively supporting the work of other leaders and their teams.
    *   Understand their goals and provide valuable information or assistance.
    *   Connect with their team members and offer support, building a reputation as a helpful and influential individual.
