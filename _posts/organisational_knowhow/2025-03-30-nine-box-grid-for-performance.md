The **9-Box Grid** is a popular talent management tool used by organizations to assess employees based on two key dimensions:

1.  **Performance** – How well an employee delivers results in their current role.
    
2.  **Potential** – Their ability to grow, take on more responsibility, and succeed in future roles.
    

### **How the 9-Box Grid Works**

Employees are plotted on a 3x3 matrix, creating nine possible categories:
| Potential/Performance   | Low Potential                      | Moderate Potential                    | High Potential                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **High Performers**   | Solid Contributors (May lack growth potential) | Emerging Talent (Develop for bigger roles) | Future Leaders (Promote & invest heavily)  |
| **Moderate Performers** | Core Employees (Maintain, limited upside)    | Growth Candidates (Develop skills)    | High Potential, Inconsistent (Needs coaching) |
| **Low Performers**     | Underperformers (Performance plan or exit)   | Mismatched Role (Redeploy or train)   | Frustrated Talent (May leave if not engaged)   |

### **Key Uses of the 9-Box Grid**

1.  **Succession Planning** – Identifies future leaders (top-right box).
    
2.  **Development Focus** – Highlights employees needing upskilling (middle boxes).
    
3.  **Retention Strategies** – High-potential but underutilized employees (bottom-right) may be flight risks.
    
4.  **Performance Management** – Helps address low performers (bottom row).
    

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

*   **Bias** – Managers may overrate favorites or misjudge potential.
    
*   **Over-reliance** – Should be combined with other data (engagement, skills assessments).
    
*   **Static View** – Employees can move between boxes over time.
