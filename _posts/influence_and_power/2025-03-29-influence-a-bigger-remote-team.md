when you are leading a small remote team, how to have influence over the project when your counterpart teams are remote and larger.

### **Embrace the "David vs. Goliath" Narrative (Subtly):** 
Instead of trying to match the resources of the larger teams, subtly position your small team as the agile, innovative underdog. Highlight your speed and flexibility as a key differentiator. When proposing ideas, frame them as "lean experiments" or "nimble solutions" that can be quickly tested and iterated upon, something the larger, more established teams might struggle with.
Instead of competing directly with larger teams, focus on becoming the "go-to" experts in a niche area of the project. This specialization builds credibility and influence, as larger teams may rely on your expertise for critical decisions

*   **Become the Go-To Expert:** Deepen your knowledge in a niche area (e.g., a specific technology, process, or customer insight) so larger teams rely on your input.
*   
### **"Pilot Project" Leverage:** 
Volunteer your team to take on a small, seemingly less critical but potentially impactful "pilot project" or a challenging edge case that the larger teams might overlook or deem too risky. If you deliver exceptional results, you gain disproportionate credibility and leverage for future, larger initiatives.


### **Leverage Influencers:**
*   Identify decision-makers and informal leaders in larger teams and cultivate alliances with them.

*   **"Shadow Metrics" for Influence:** If the main project metrics don't fully capture the value your team is contributing, subtly track and present "shadow metrics" that highlight your impact in a different, but relevant, way.

### **Leverage Asynchronous Influence**

*   **Document Everything:** Use shared wikis (Notion, Confluence) or project trackers (Jira, Trello) to ensure your teamâ€™s work is visible.
    
*   **Write Persuasive Updates:** Summarize progress, blockers, and next steps in a structured format (e.g., bullet points, dashboards) to keep stakeholders aligned.
    
*   **Pre-Meeting Alignment:** Share key messages or proposals with decision-makers before meetings to secure buy-in early.

### **Trade Favors:**
Offer to help larger teams with their pain points in exchange for their support on your priorities.
