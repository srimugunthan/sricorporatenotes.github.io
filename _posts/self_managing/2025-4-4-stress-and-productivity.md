Stress hinders productivity
=============================

*   **Impaired Thinking:** Stress negatively impacts cognitive functions such as attention, concentration, and memory. When stressed, individuals may find it harder to focus on tasks, leading to more errors and reduced efficiency. 
*   **Reduced Decision-Making Ability:** Stress can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive or poor decisions. This can result in wasted time and resources on ineffective strategies or actions. 
*   **Lowered Energy Levels:** Chronic stress can lead to fatigue and exhaustion, making it difficult to maintain the energy and motivation needed to be productive throughout the day.

*   **Damaged Motivation and Engagement:** High levels of stress can diminish enthusiasm for work and reduce overall engagement, leading to a decline in the quality and quantity of output. 
*   **Difficulty Managing Time:** Stress can make it harder to prioritize tasks and manage time effectively, leading to a feeling of being overwhelmed and less organized. 
*   **Increased Errors and Reduced Quality:** When stressed, individuals are more prone to making mistakes, which can require additional time and effort to correct, ultimately decreasing productivity.
