    *   This is achieved through:
        *   **Knowledgeability:** Possessing and sharing valuable expertise.
        *   **Accessibility:** Fostering two-way communication and engagement.
        *   **Kindness:** Prioritizing the emotional well-being of others.

    *   Influence is a gradual process, constructed through consistent and meaningful interactions.
