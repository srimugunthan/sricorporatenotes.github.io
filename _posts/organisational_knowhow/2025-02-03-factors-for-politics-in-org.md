Factors that results in politics in organisations
==================================================
1.  **Scarcity of Resources**: Limited resources (power, promotions, information) lead employees to engage in political behavior to gain advantages over others .
    
2.  **Manpower Diversity**: A heterogeneous workforce consisting of people from varied backgrounds can create dynamics that trigger political behavior due to differing perspectives and interests .
    
3.  **Relationship Conflicts**: Conflicts among employees can foster an environment where politics thrive, as individuals may seek to navigate or manipulate these relationships for personal gain .
    
4.  **Power Struggles**: Where there are competitions for power and influence within the organization, political behaviors are likely to emerge as employees vie for dominance .
    
5.  **Centralization of Organizational Structure**: A centralized structure can contribute to organizational politics, as it may limit decision-making power and create frustrations among employees .
    
6.  **Role Ambiguity and Conflicts**: Unclear roles can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, promoting political behavior as individuals maneuver to establish their positions and gain clarity .

It has been recognized that factors such as manpower diversity, relationship conflicts, power struggles, and organizational structure significantly contribute to organizational politics. These factors create environments conducive to political behavior.

**Impact on Employee Behavior:**  
Organizational politics often lead to negative outcomes, including high levels of employee withdrawal behavior. Employees who encounter political maneuvering are likely to disengage from their duties, which negatively affects productivity and morale.

**Role of Management:**  
Management plays a critical role in the detection and handling of political behaviors within the workplace. Effective leadership is key to counteracting the adverse effects of politics and promoting a fair and cohesive working environment.

**Strategic Recommendations:**  
It is recommended that organizational leaders implement strategies to curb dysfunctional political behavior. Strategies should include fostering open communication, encouraging team building, and establishing clear mechanisms for resolving conflicts.

**Theoretical Insights:**  
The application of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory in this context highlights how politics-induced resource loss or the perception of such loss can trigger withdrawal behaviors. This understanding is crucial for effectively managing workplace stressors.
