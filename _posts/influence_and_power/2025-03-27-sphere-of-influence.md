Sphere of influence
====================

While there isn't a universally fixed number, a **Lead** typically has a sphere of influence that is **smaller** than that of a manager.

I would estimate a Lead's sphere of direct influence to be around **3 to 7 people**.

Here's why:

*   **Focus on Technical Guidance:** Leads often spend a significant portion of their time providing technical guidance, mentorship, and unblocking their direct reports. This requires more focused and frequent interaction with a smaller group.
*   **Less Administrative Overhead:** Unlike managers, Leads usually have fewer administrative responsibilities like performance reviews, promotions, and budget management. This allows them to concentrate on the technical aspects of their team and individual contributors.
*   **Team Structure:** Team structures often have a manager overseeing multiple Leads, each responsible for a smaller subset of the overall team.

It's important to note that this is an estimated range and can vary based on factors like:

*   **Team maturity and experience:** A Lead might be able to effectively guide a larger group of more experienced individuals.
*   **Complexity of the work:** Highly complex projects might require a Lead to have a smaller, more focused team.
*   **Organizational structure:** Some organizations might define Lead roles with slightly broader responsibilities.

However, based on common understanding, **3 to 7 people** is a reasonable estimate for the direct sphere of influence of a Lead.
