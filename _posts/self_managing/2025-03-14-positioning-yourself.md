Positioning
============

Positioning yourself correctly in your career and within a corporate environment is indeed crucial for strategic success. Here are key aspects to consider:

Strategic Position in Corporate Settings
----------------------------------------

1.  **Identify value centers**: Position yourself near or within departments that drive revenue or are critical to the organization's core mission. Being close to where value is created gives you visibility and influence.
2.  **Develop cross-functional expertise**: The most valuable employees often sit at the intersection of different domains. Someone who understands both technology and business strategy, for example, can bridge critical gaps.
3.  **Build relationships upward, downward, and laterally**: Your network is your support system. Cultivate relationships with senior leaders (for sponsorship), peers (for collaboration), and junior staff (for execution and future talent).
4.  **Solve meaningful problems**: Position yourself to address challenges that matter to key decision-makers. Demonstrate your ability to resolve issues that impact the organization's strategic goals.
5.  **Control critical information flows**: Become a node where important information passes through. This could mean being the connection point between departments or between the organization and external stakeholders.

Career Positioning
------------------

1.  **Differentiate yourself**: Develop a unique combination of skills that makes you valuable in your industry. This could be specialized knowledge, rare technical abilities, or unusual combinations of expertise.
2.  **Maintain optionality**: Position yourself to have multiple potential career paths. This gives you leverage in negotiations and resilience during industry changes.
3.  **Align with growth**: Identify growing industries, companies, or departments and position yourself within them. Growth creates opportunities for advancement.
4.  **Build a personal brand**: Become known for something specific that aligns with your long-term goals. This could be through speaking, writing, or consistently delivering results in a particular area.
5.  **Cultivate portable skills**: Develop capabilities that maintain value across different companies and industries, giving you flexibility to move as opportunities arise.

   In your personal career, positioning determines how you're perceived, the opportunities you attract, and your ability to shape your own trajectory.

1.  **Identify Your Unique Edge**
    
    *   What rare combination of skills, experiences, and perspectives do you have?
    *   If you’re in AI/ML and financial services, maybe your niche is designing risk-aware AI models or leading regulatory-compliant AI implementations.
2.  **Be in the Right Company & Function**
    
    *   Pick companies that are well-positioned in their market (growth-stage startups, market leaders).
    *   Within a company, choose high-leverage functions (AI/ML in financial services, data-driven decision-making roles, etc.).
3.  **Build a Strong Internal Brand**
    
    *   Be the go-to person for solving strategic problems in your domain.
    *   Communicate your impact clearly—people who articulate their value well get noticed.
    *   Example: If you drive AI adoption in consumer finance, ensure leadership knows its revenue impact.
4.  **Choose Projects that Increase Visibility & Scarcity**
    
    *   Work on initiatives aligned with executive priorities.
    *   Develop a skill set that is both high in demand and low in supply (e.g., AI fairness in financial risk models).
    *   Take on roles where your impact is clear—P&L ownership, high-growth areas, etc.
5.  **Be in High-Leverage Networks**
    
    *   Build relationships with decision-makers and industry leaders.
    *   Join communities where future opportunities emerge (VC networks, AI/ML think tanks).
    *   Example: Being a thought leader in AI applications for financial services will keep you on the radar of influential people.
6.  **Control the Narrative of Your Career**
    
    *   Your positioning should be proactive, not reactive.
    *   Own your story: Are you the "go-to expert in AI strategy for financial services"? If so, that should reflect in your LinkedIn, public talks, and internal communication.
