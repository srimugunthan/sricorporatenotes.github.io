 Political Skill Inventory (PSI)
==================================
The Political Skill Inventory (PSI) is a tool designed to measure an individual's political skill, particularly within organizational settings. Here's a breakdown of what that entails: 

*   **Core Concept:**
    
    *   Political skill, in this context, refers to the ability to effectively understand others at work and to use that understanding to influence them in ways that enhance personal and/or organizational objectives. 
    *   It's important to distinguish this from "organizational politics" which often has negative connotations. Political skill, as measured by the PSI, emphasizes positive, sincere, and effective influence. 
*   **Key Components:**
    
    *   The PSI, developed by Ferris and colleagues, typically assesses political skill across four dimensions:
        
        *   **Social Astuteness:** The ability to accurately observe and interpret social situations and behaviors. 
        *   **Interpersonal Influence:** The capacity to build rapport and effectively influence others.
        *   **Networking Ability:** The skill of developing and leveraging relationships.
        *   **Apparent Sincerity:** The ability to appear genuine and authentic.
     

  **Questions for self assessment**

  It's important to understand that the Political Skill Inventory (PSI) is typically administered with specific, structured questions. However, I can provide you with examples of self-assessment questions that reflect the core dimensions of political skill:

**Based on the Four Dimensions of the PSI:**

*   **Social Astuteness:**
    *   "How well do I understand the unspoken rules of my workplace?"
    *   "Am I good at reading people's nonverbal cues?"
    *   "Can I accurately perceive the power dynamics in social situations?"
    *   "Do I pay close attention to peoples' facial expressions?"
    *   "Am I particularly good at sensing the motivations and hidden agendas of others?"
*   **Interpersonal Influence:**
    *   "How effective am I at persuading others?"
    *   "Can I easily build rapport with people from different backgrounds?"
    *   "Am I able to make most people feel comfortable and at ease around me?"
    *   "It is easy for me to develop good rapport with most people."
    *   "I always seem to instinctively know the right things to say or do to influence others." 
*   **Networking Ability:**
    *   "How strong is my professional network?"
    *   "Do I actively cultivate relationships with key people?"
    *   "I spend a lot of time and effort at work networking with others."
    *   "I am good at building relationships with influential people at work."
    *   "I have developed a large network of colleagues and associates at work who I can call on for support when I really need to get things done." 
*   **Apparent Sincerity:**
    *   "Do people perceive me as genuine and trustworthy?"
    *   "Am I consistent in my words and actions?"
    *   "It is important that people believe I am sincere in what I say and do."
