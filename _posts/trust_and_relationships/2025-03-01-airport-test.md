Airport test
=============
The "airport test" is a concept often used in hiring and decision-making, particularly in fields like consulting, but also more broadly in business. It essentially refers to: 

*   **A subjective assessment of whether someone is likable and easy to get along with.** 

Here's a breakdown of what that means:

*   The idea is that if you were stuck in an airport with someone for an extended period, would you enjoy their company? Would they be someone you could have a pleasant conversation with?
*   In a professional context, this translates to:
    *   Would this person be a good fit for our team?
    *   Would they represent our company well to clients?
    *   Are they someone we would enjoy working with on a regular basis?
*   It's about more than just qualifications; it's about personality, interpersonal skills, and how well someone fits into the company culture.
*   This test is also used in a personal way, when people are trying to decide if they are on the right path in life. Imagining running into someone you have not seen in many years at an airport, and being able to honestly say that your life is going amazing. This is used as a tool for self reflection.

In essence, the airport test acknowledges that while technical skills are important, so are "soft skills" like communication, personality, and the ability to build rapport
