The fastest way to learn about your HR and company policies typically involves a few key steps:

1.  **Employee Handbook:** Start by reviewing the employee handbook if your company provides one. This document often contains comprehensive information about company policies, workplace expectations, and HR procedures.
    
2.  **HR Portal:** Many companies have an internal HR portal or intranet site where policies and procedures are posted. This can be a quick way to access up-to-date information on various topics like leave policies, benefits, and compliance guidelines.
    
3.  **HR Department:** Reach out directly to your HR department. They can provide specific documents, answer questions, and clarify any uncertainties about policies or procedures. Setting up a meeting or a brief call with someone from HR can be particularly effective.
    
4.  **Training Sessions:** Attend any available training sessions or orientation programs. These sessions are designed to bring employees up to speed on the company's policies and procedures.
    
5.  **Ask Colleagues:** Sometimes, colleagues who have been with the company longer can provide practical insights and tips on navigating the policies effectively.
    
6.  **Regular Updates:** Keep an eye out for emails or bulletins from HR. Companies often send out updates when there are changes to policies.
