Poor communication skills
=========================

**Poor Communication Skills:**

*   **Using overly technical jargon with non-technical stakeholders:** Failing to explain technical concepts in a way that project managers, designers, or business users can understand, leading to misunderstandings and misalignment.
*   **Being vague or unclear in instructions:** Providing ambiguous tasks or requirements to team members, resulting in confusion, rework, and delays. For example, saying "fix the bug" without specifying which bug, the expected outcome, or any constraints.
*   **Not actively listening to team members:** Dismissing concerns, interrupting frequently, or failing to solicit and consider input from the team during discussions or meetings.
*   **Poor written communication:** Sending emails or documentation with grammatical errors, typos, or disorganized information, making it difficult to understand.
*   **Avoiding difficult conversations:** Failing to address performance issues, provide constructive feedback, or communicate bad news to the team in a timely and transparent manner.
*   **Lack of transparency:** Withholding important information from the team, leading to feelings of being out of the loop and a lack of trust. For instance, not sharing context about project changes or challenges.
*   **Inconsistent communication:** Providing updates sporadically or through different channels without a clear strategy, making it hard for the team to stay informed.
*   **Not setting clear expectations:** Failing to communicate deadlines, quality standards, or the desired outcome of tasks, leading to unmet expectations.
*   **One-way communication:** Primarily broadcasting information without creating opportunities for dialogue, questions, or feedback from the team.
*   **Reacting poorly to questions or challenges:** Becoming defensive, dismissive, or impatient when team members seek clarification or raise concerns.
