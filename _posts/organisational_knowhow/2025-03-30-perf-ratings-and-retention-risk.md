Retention risk and performance ratings
=======================================

 the risk of someone leaving (often referred to as "flight risk" or "retention risk") is sometimes factored into performance ratings, depending on the organization's talent management practices. Hereâ€™s how it typically works:

### 1. **High Performers at Risk of Leaving**

*   Top performers with a high risk of leaving (e.g., due to burnout, lack of career growth, or competitive job offers) may receive special attention in performance reviews.
    
*   Managers may adjust ratings or development plans to ensure retention (e.g., higher bonuses, promotions, or stretch assignments).
    

### 2. **Low Performers at Risk of Leaving**

*   If a low performer is likely to leave voluntarily, some organizations may rate them neutrally to avoid conflict or accelerate their departure.
    
*   Others may use performance ratings to manage them out proactively.
    

### 3. **9-Box Grid & Talent Reviews**

Many companies use a **9-box grid** (performance vs. potential) where retention risk is an additional consideration. High performers with high flight risk may be flagged for retention strategies.

### 4. **HR & Leadership Influence**

*   HR analytics often identify flight risks based on engagement surveys, market trends, and individual behavior (e.g., declining participation, LinkedIn activity).
    
*   Leadership may adjust ratings or compensation to mitigate turnover risks.
    

### 5. **Potential Biases & Challenges**

*   Some argue that factoring in flight risk can distort true performance ratings (e.g., overrating someone just to retain them).
    
*   Transparent criteria are needed to avoid favoritism or unfair adjustments.
    

### Best Practices:

*   Separate **performance ratings** (past results) from **potential/retention assessments** (future risk).
    
*   Address flight risks through **personalized retention plans** (career pathing, mentorship, compensation adjustments) rather than inflating ratings.
