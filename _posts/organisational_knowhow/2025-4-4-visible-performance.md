Visible performance
====================

To **win** in  "visible performance" culture, you need to **strategically showcase your impact** while aligning with leadership expectations. Here’s how to thrive—and avoid being overlooked or PIP’d:

* * *

### **1\. Master the  Narrative**

Master **written communication** (6-pagers, PR/FAQs, docs). Your work must be:

*   **Data-driven**: Attach clear metrics (e.g., "Improved delivery speed by 15%, saving $2M annually").
    
*   **Tied to business impact**: Connect your work to revenue, customer experience, or efficiency.
    
*   **Well-documented**: Use **Amazon’s writing culture** to your advantage—polished docs get visibility.
    

**Pro Tip:** Before a big meeting, socialize your doc with key stakeholders to pre-sell your ideas.

* * *

### **2\. Own High-Visibility Projects**

Not all work is equally valued. Prioritize:

*   **Customer-facing improvements** (metrics like NPS, conversion rates).
    
*   **Leadership-principled initiatives** (e.g., "Invent and Simplify" or "Earn Trust").
    
*   **Projects sponsored by senior leaders** (they naturally get more attention).
    

**Avoid:** "Invisible work" (e.g., fixing legacy systems without a clear story). If you must do it, **reframe it as innovation**.

* * *

### **3\. Be Loud (But Strategic) About Your Wins**

*   **Quantify everything**: Use **S-team level** metrics (what Jeff Bezos would care about).
    
*   **Use weekly business reviews (WBRs), QBRs, or OP1/OP2 cycles** to highlight contributions.
    
*   **Get endorsements**: Have your manager or a senior leader mention your work in meetings.
    

**Trick:** If your manager isn’t advocating for you, **build relationships with skip-level leaders**.

* * *

### **4\. Navigate Stack Ranking Like a Pro**

*   **Know where you stand**: Ask for **direct feedback** in 1:1s. ("How can I move to the top 20%?")
    
*   **Align with top performers**: Work on their projects—association lifts your ranking.
    
*   **Avoid the "bottom 10% trap"**: If given vague feedback, **demand specifics** and act fast.
    

**Warning:** If you’re told you’re "at risk," immediately **document your impact** and seek mentorship.

* * *

### **5\. Leverage ’Leadership Principles**

Frame your work using **Company’s core values**:

*   **"Deliver Results"** → Show hard numbers.
    
*   **"Dive Deep"** → Prove you understand the system.
    
*   **"Earn Trust"** → Build alliances with key stakeholders.
    

**Example:** Instead of saying, "I fixed a bug," say:

> _"By diving deep into our checkout flow, I identified a 12% drop-off point, implemented a fix (Invent and Simplify), and improved conversion by 8% (Deliver Results), impacting $5M in annual revenue."_

* * *

### **6\. Manage Up (Your Boss is Your #1 Customer)**

*   **Know your manager’s priorities** and tie your work to their success.
    
*   **Send monthly "accomplishment summaries"** (bullet points with metrics).
    
*   **If your boss is weak at advocacy**, find mentors in other teams.
    

* * *

### **Final Tip: Play the Long Game**

*   **Rotate roles every 2-3 years** to stay visible (Amazon loves "reinvention").
    
*   **Build a "brand"** (e.g., "the person who fixes broken processes" or "the data wizard").
    
*   **If stuck in a low-visibility role, transfer**—some orgs have more upward mobility.
    

* * *

### **Key Takeaway**

Winning at visible performance culture isn’t just about **hard work**—it’s about **visible, measurable, and well-communicated impact**. Document everything, align with leadership principles, and **make sure the right people see your contributions**.
