Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Purpose, Methodology, and Strategic Applications
=======================================================================================

Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a method for examining the informal connections and collaboration patterns that drive how work actually gets done in an organization. Unlike traditional org charts, which show formal reporting lines, ONA maps **who interacts with whom**, revealing the real pathways of information, influence, and decision-making. By analyzing communication flows and relationships, ONA provides data-driven insight into organizational dynamics – how decisions are made, how knowledge is shared, and where collaboration is thriving or breaking down. In essence, it offers an “x-ray” of the company’s social structure beyond job titles, allowing leaders to see key influencers, hidden bottlenecks, and silos that are invisible on a standard org chart.

_Figure: Organizational Network Analysis visualizes employee connections as networks. This example graph shows two distinct clusters (in blue and red) of individuals and the links between them. Each node represents a person, and each line represents a relationship or interaction. By visualizing these patterns, ONA highlights community structures and the bridge connections joining them, offering insight into how information and collaboration flow across the organization._

Purpose of ONA
--------------

ONA’s core purpose is to make the **invisible webs of collaboration and influence** within an organization visible and measurable. It brings **“hard evidence”** to what are often considered soft organizational aspects – mapping how communications, information, decisions, and resources _truly_ flow on a daily basis. By quantifying who talks to whom and how frequently, ONA replaces guesswork with facts, helping leaders base interventions on data rather than gut feel. This analysis bridges the gap between formal structure and actual working relationships: it highlights critical connectors, influential players, and potential problem areas (like isolated teams or overloaded individuals) that may not align with the org chart. In short, the purpose of ONA is to provide a **data-driven understanding** of the organization’s social structure, so that strategies for improvement (in leadership, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc.) can target the right areas.

Methodology of ONA
------------------

**Data Collection (Active vs. Passive):** ONA can be conducted through active or passive data collection methods. _Active ONA_ typically uses surveys or interviews, asking employees questions like “Who do you collaborate with regularly?” or “Whom do you go to for advice?”. This yields rich relational data (including the strength and type of relationships) but relies on individuals to self-report their networks. _Passive ONA_ taps into digital “exhaust” from everyday work tools – mining communication metadata from email, calendar meetings, chat apps, or social platforms to infer connections. Modern ONA solutions increasingly leverage these passive data sources (e.g. Slack or Microsoft Teams messages, email logs, meeting invites) to automatically map out networks without extra burden on employees. Often, **combining both** approaches provides the most complete picture: surveys capture nuanced context (like who people trust or find energizing), while system data provides objective evidence of interaction frequency. All data is typically anonymized or aggregated appropriately to address privacy concerns while still revealing overall network patterns.

**Network Mapping and Metrics:** Once data is gathered, specialized software or algorithms are used to create network maps and calculate metrics. Individuals (or sometimes teams) become **nodes** in the network graph, and interactions (e.g. communications, information exchanges) form the **ties** or links between nodes. The resulting visualization shows clusters of high interaction and the links bridging different groups. Analysts then compute key network **metrics** to quantify roles and structure: for example, **centrality** measures identify how pivotal a person is in the network (a high _betweenness centrality_ indicates a person lies on many connection paths and could be a broker or bottleneck). **Network density** measures how interconnected a group is overall. These metrics help flag unusual patterns – such as an overly centralized network that might depend too much on a few people. The analysis often classifies people into network roles defined in organizational network theory: for instance, a **“central node”** is an individual who knows many others and can spread information quickly, a **“knowledge broker”** connects otherwise disconnected groups, and a **“peripheral”** node is someone with few connections into the network. Identifying these roles is a crucial part of the methodology because it pinpoints where influence and information reside. Finally, findings are interpreted in business context – often by overlaying network insights with performance or demographic data – to inform interventions. The output of an ONA is both **visual (maps)** and **analytical (metrics and reports)**, providing a comprehensive view of the informal organization.

Strategic Applications of ONA
-----------------------------

With a clear map of how people really interact, organizations can apply ONA insights in many strategic areas. Key applications include enhancing leadership effectiveness, optimizing collaboration, improving knowledge flow, fostering innovation, and informing decision-making. Below, we break down each area and how ONA delivers value:

### Leadership Effectiveness

ONA is a powerful tool for identifying and leveraging **informal leaders** within a company. Often, the people who have the most influence are not those with big titles, but those who sit at the hubs of communication networks. ONA reveals these **key connectors** – employees who are widely trusted and consulted by others – so that management can recognize and empower them. Studies have found that formal org charts often miss these real influencers; the “go-to” people in a network may be in middle or junior roles yet wield significant influence. By pinpointing who these central nodes are, leadership can involve them in change initiatives, disseminate information more effectively, and avoid the mistake of relying solely on hierarchy for communication. In practice, organizations use ONA to ensure that the _real_ leaders and culture carriers are on board when driving transformations, which increases the success rate of change adoption. Furthermore, understanding the network can help formal leaders improve their own effectiveness – for example, by showing a manager if they are too isolated (low connectivity) or if they only interact within a silo. During times of uncertainty or crisis, tapping into informal leaders becomes especially important: these individuals often guide and reassure colleagues through challenges, acting as stabilizing forces. By identifying them in advance, the organization can deliberately **engage informal influencers** to champion new initiatives, mentor others, and keep morale high. In summary, ONA enhances leadership effectiveness by shining a light on the human networks that drive influence, allowing the company to **recognize, develop, and utilize true leaders** at all levels.

### Collaboration Optimization

One of the most common uses of ONA is to **break down silos and improve collaboration** across an organization. The network view makes it immediately apparent where collaboration is thriving and where it’s lagging. For example, ONA may show that two departments that should work closely together (say, R&D and Marketing) have very few direct interactions – a warning sign of a silo. With this insight, leaders and HR can intervene by creating cross-functional project teams, communities of practice, or mentorship programs to bridge the gap. ONA effectively highlights the **white spaces** between formal structures – revealing, for instance, that Team X barely communicates with Team Y – so the organization can proactively connect those groups. Conversely, it also uncovers any _over-collaboration_ or **bottlenecks**: sometimes a few individuals become the only link between many teams and get overloaded with requests. Those people might be delaying information flow simply because _everything_ routes through them. By detecting such patterns (e.g. someone appearing as an intermediary in too many interactions), ONA allows work to be redistributed more evenly and processes re-routed to **avoid collaboration overload**. Overall, using ONA for collaboration optimization means the company can **tune its informal structure**: strengthening connections where communication is weak, relieving overtaxed hubs, and ensuring critical information has multiple paths to travel. The result is a more resilient network that enables knowledge and ideas to circulate freely rather than getting stuck in departmental silos.

### Knowledge Flow and Knowledge Sharing

In knowledge-driven organizations, **ensuring effective knowledge flow** is vital. ONA helps by mapping who shares information with whom, and where expertise resides or gets trapped. A well-connected network will have multiple **knowledge brokers** linking different teams – these are the people who, say, talk to both Engineering and Sales and can carry ideas between them. ONA identifies such brokers and also spots gaps where knowledge _isn’t_ flowing. For instance, if a particular expert or team is only connected to a small circle, their specialized knowledge might not be reaching the rest of the organization. Without the bridges that ONA highlights, **information and idea sharing can grind to a halt**. By discovering these weak points, leaders can take steps to connect isolated experts or document their knowledge before it’s lost. One study described the case of an _exceptional software developer_ who was highly skilled but sitting at the network’s periphery – not teaching others and not plugged into broader communication. Such a person represents untapped knowledge and also a flight risk (since they may feel disconnected); ONA brought this to light so the company could integrate them better. More broadly, ONA uncovers “who knows what” and how that know-how circulates. It might reveal, for example, that **critical know-how is concentrated** in a few veterans who all frequently consult each other but little with newcomers – a sign that onboarding or mentoring needs improvement. Using ONA, organizations can facilitate knowledge transfer by formally linking these veterans with the rest or by establishing knowledge-sharing platforms. In essence, ONA ensures that valuable knowledge doesn’t stay locked in silos or in people’s heads. It provides visibility into the **informal knowledge network**, helping the organization promote learning, reduce redundant work, and avoid single points of failure where only one person holds key information. By actively managing the knowledge flow (e.g. assigning “knowledge champions” in each group or creating cross-team expert circles), companies maintain agility and prevent the loss of expertise over time.

### Innovation and Creativity

Innovation often sparks at the **intersections of diverse ideas** – when people from different backgrounds or departments connect and share perspectives. ONA is therefore a valuable tool for fostering innovation, as it shows whether an organization’s network is set up to enable these creative collisions. A highly siloed network, where R&D only talks internally and never with customer-facing teams, for example, can stifle innovation. Using ONA, management can identify opportunities to connect **disparate groups to spark new ideas**. The analysis might find key individuals who serve as bridges between otherwise disconnected teams – these are innovation brokers who, if supported, can help cross-pollinate ideas across the company. By recognizing who they are, the organization can give them more platforms (like innovation task forces or brainstorming sessions) to amplify their bridging role. Conversely, ONA might flag that a certain strategic function (say, a research lab or a creative design unit) is **too isolated** in the network. Leadership can then take action to plug that team into the broader community – maybe by pairing them with an operations team for joint projects or rotating members through other units – so that their creativity spreads and they also get input from others. In a practical sense, some companies have used ONA to form **“innovation networks”** deliberately, ensuring that employees who don’t usually interact are introduced and encouraged to collaborate, thereby seeding innovation. The data-driven nature of ONA helps avoid relying on chance for these connections. It can also monitor over time whether an organization is becoming more internally networked or if silos are re-forming, which is useful feedback for innovation programs. In summary, ONA helps create a network environment where **fresh ideas can emerge**: it connects silos, identifies the brokers and creative hubs, and guides management in nurturing a culture of collaboration and experimentation that is essential for innovation.

### Informed Decision-Making

Complex decisions in organizations are rarely made by one person alone – often they percolate through advice networks and consensus-building behind the scenes. ONA provides clarity on these **decision networks** by revealing how decisions and information flow in reality. For instance, it might show that whenever a technical decision is needed, a particular engineer who isn’t in management is nonetheless consulted by many others – a hidden influencer in decisions. Knowing this, leaders can formally include that person in relevant decision-making meetings or at least recognize their input. Similarly, ONA might uncover that a middle manager is a _bottleneck_ for decisions because all issues route to them, slowing things down – prompting a need to delegate or empower others. By mapping who consults whom, organizations get a **data-driven view of influence**: they can identify the key influencers to involve early in any big decision or change. This makes decisions more robust, as those influencers will propagate understanding and buy-in among their peers. Additionally, ONA helps **diversify input** into decisions. It can highlight if certain groups (say, front-line staff) are never part of the consultation network, indicating a blind spot. Leaders can then widen the decision network by bringing those voices in, leading to more well-rounded outcomes. In terms of governance, understanding the informal decision flow can also help align it with formal processes – if ONA shows decisions are mostly happening in ad-hoc hallway chats or private Slack messages, management might establish more transparent forums or cross-functional committees to capture that. Importantly, ONA’s visualization of decision and communication paths helps eliminate biases and gut-feel hierarchies in decision-making. Instead of assuming the chain of command is the only route, leaders see the _actual_ routes and can adjust accordingly. Overall, integrating ONA into decision-making leads to **more informed, inclusive, and quicker decisions**. It ensures that critical stakeholders (formal or informal) are not overlooked and that information reaches those who need to act on it. The result is a decision process grounded in how the organization truly operates, which improves both the quality and acceptance of decisions across the network.

Tools Facilitating ONA and Integration with Outlook, Gmail, Slack, and Teams
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To harness ONA effectively, organizations often turn to specialized tools that can **collect and analyze interaction data from the software employees use every day**. Modern ONA and “collaboration analytics” platforms integrate with email systems, calendars, and chat/workstream apps to automatically gather relationship data. By plugging into **popular office applications** – such as Microsoft Outlook/Exchange (for email), calendar systems, Gmail, Slack, and Microsoft Teams – these tools can passively map networks in real time. They typically pull **metadata** (e.g. who emailed whom, meeting attendance, message frequencies) rather than content, to protect privacy while still inferring connections. Using these integrations, ONA tools turn the digital traces of work into insights about collaboration patterns. Below is an overview of several notable ONA tools, their key features, and how they help leverage ONA findings for strategic advantage:

### Microsoft Viva Insights (Workplace Analytics)

**Microsoft Viva Insights** (formerly Workplace Analytics) is an ONA and people analytics solution built into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. It leverages the wealth of data from Outlook email and calendars, Microsoft Teams meetings and chats, and other Office 365 services to analyze how employees collaborate. Because it’s native to Office 365, it can automatically capture metrics like: the number of hours spent in meetings, the network size of each employee (unique collaborators via email/Teams), response times, after-hours work, and cross-department communication frequency. Leaders and analysts access Viva Insights through dashboards and an Analyst Workbench to visualize networks and trends. For example, Viva can generate an **organizational network map** showing how different departments interact, or identify which teams have become insular versus which are well-connected across the org. In 2024, Microsoft even introduced a dedicated **ONA report template** in Viva Insights, allowing users to run before-and-after analyses on collaboration patterns around events like reorganizations. Key features of Viva Insights include the ability to compare collaboration **before vs. after a change**, analyze information flow at group and subgroup levels, and produce both network graphs and statistics to guide decisions. By integrating deeply with Outlook and Teams data, Viva Insights provides continuous, up-to-date measurements of the organizational network without any surveys. This helps leaders track the impact of initiatives (e.g. is a cross-functional project actually increasing inter-team collaboration?) and spot problem areas (like overload or siloing) early. The strategic advantage of Viva Insights is that it **brings ONA into the flow of work** – companies can regularly monitor and improve collaboration health using the tools employees already rely on, with Microsoft’s analytics turning raw digital signals into actionable recommendations.

### Polinode

**Polinode** is a dedicated Organizational Network Analysis platform that offers robust analytics and flexible data integration capabilities. It is designed to make running ONA studies easier, whether for internal HR teams or consultants. A key strength of Polinode is its ability to **connect directly to enterprise data sources** to gather network data. It provides out-of-the-box integrations with systems like Microsoft Office 365 (including Exchange email and Calendar), Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Active Directory. Setting up these integrations is straightforward – an administrator simply grants Polinode secure access (OAuth) to the company’s tenant, and the tool will import communication metadata (e.g. email headers, meeting participant lists, chat channels) automatically. This means Polinode can continuously capture who is collaborating with whom across email and messaging platforms. Notably, Polinode allows combining multiple data sources into one unified network analysis; for example, one could merge **Office 365 email data and Teams chat data** to get a comprehensive view of digital interactions in the organization. It even supports importing the formal org structure (e.g. “reports-to” relationships from Active Directory) so you can compare informal networks against hierarchy. Once data is in, Polinode provides a suite of network visualization and analysis tools through an interactive interface. Users can see graphs of the organization’s network, filter by departments or attributes, and apply analytics like centrality or community detection to identify clusters. Polinode’s feature set aligns with common ONA use cases: it can **identify influencers** (highlighting people with many connections or high betweenness centrality), find **brokers** between siloed groups, and **spot collaboration overload** (if certain individuals have an unusually high number of connections, for instance). The platform also supports _active ONA_ via surveys if needed, which can be combined with the passive data. By using Polinode, organizations gain a powerful, flexible way to continuously analyze their networks. The direct integration with tools like Slack and Outlook means the network insights are always current. This helps in making timely strategic decisions – for example, detecting emerging silos or key connectors and acting on that insight (perhaps to support an overloaded connector, or to formally link isolated teams) before issues escalate. In summary, Polinode delivers a **comprehensive ONA solution** that integrates with everyday communication tools, enabling data-driven interventions in organizational design, collaboration improvements, and change management based on the real patterns of interaction within the company.

### Worklytics

**Worklytics** is a people analytics platform that focuses on analyzing work patterns and collaboration using data from cloud applications. It is often used to understand productivity, well-being (burnout risk), and team dynamics by examining how work happens across various tools. Worklytics comes with a rich set of **integrations spanning both Microsoft and Google ecosystems, as well as other popular tools**. For example, it can connect to Google Workspace data (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Drive, etc.), Microsoft 365 data (Exchange email, Outlook Calendar, Teams), and enterprise apps like Slack, Zoom, Asana, Jira, and GitHub. Through these integrations, Worklytics collects metadata such as email send/receive timestamps, meeting attendance, chat message counts, file collaboration events, and more – without reading the actual content of communications. The platform then **analyzes this aggregated data in real-time** to produce insights on network structure and work habits. Key features include dashboards that might show, for instance, how much time different teams spend in meetings vs. focus time, or what the average response time to emails is across departments. From an ONA perspective, Worklytics can map out collaboration networks by mining those data sources: it can tell which teams or individuals interact frequently and which are isolated. It might highlight that Team A’s members predominantly communicate among themselves and rarely with other teams, signaling a silo, or show that certain employees have an exceptionally broad network of contacts (which could be both a positive sign of influence and a risk of overload). One powerful aspect of Worklytics is its ability to correlate network metrics with outcomes – for example, correlating an employee’s network diversity with their performance or risk of burnout (if someone’s network shrinks and their collaboration drops, it might indicate disengagement). Worklytics emphasizes privacy – often reporting at an aggregated level or using anonymous IDs – so that patterns are visible without exposing personal details. By **integrating with tools like Gmail, Outlook, Slack, and Zoom**, Worklytics provides organizations a continuous pulse on how collaboration is evolving. This allows leaders to experiment and quickly see the impact: if a no-meetings policy is introduced on Wednesdays, the data will show whether employees got more focus time and whether cross-team emails or chats increased as a result. For strategic ONA use, Worklytics helps in **identifying networking gaps or overburdened team members** and tracking improvements over time. Its broad integration means it can unify data from a hybrid application environment (e.g., some teams on Google, others on Microsoft, plus Slack for messaging) into one coherent view of the organizational network. The strategic advantage is actionable insight: companies can spot where collaboration patterns are hindering performance or well-being and take targeted actions (such as reorganizing team interactions, balancing workloads, or investing in certain collaboration tools) supported by the metrics Worklytics provides.

### Other ONA Tools and Integration Approaches

Beyond the above, there are several other tools and methods in the ONA landscape that help companies leverage network insights:

*   **Cognitive Talent Solutions** – This is an example of a vendor that specializes in ONA as part of HR analytics. Such platforms often combine passive data analysis with active surveys to identify informal leaders and measure team network health, and they integrate with HR systems to link network data with talent metrics (e.g., performance, engagement scores). These solutions aim to help in leadership development and organizational design by pinpointing the social capital each individual brings to the company network.
    
*   **Humanyze** – Humanyze is known for its “People Analytics” badge sensors, but it also integrates digital data (email, chat, calendar) to map both face-to-face and digital networks. Tools like this provide unique insights, for example showing that even if two departments email often, their in-person interaction might be low (or vice versa). They often focus on workplace redesign, team cohesion, and even office space utilization (who sits near whom and how that affects collaboration).
    
*   **Teamspective** – Teamspective (the author of one of the earlier cited articles) provides ONA as part of a broader employee feedback and engagement suite. It can gather relationship data via quick surveys and also hook into tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to passively gauge interactions. This blend helps not only map the network but also understand the quality of collaborations (e.g., who provides clarity or energy to others). The integration with chat platforms means it can continuously update the network and even deliver nudges or insights to users (like identifying who a new hire should connect with).
    
*   **Social Network Analysis Software** – In some cases, organizations use general-purpose network analysis tools to conduct ONA. Software like **NodeXL, Gephi, SocioViz,** or **TouchGraph** can take HR or IT data exports (for example, a CSV of email connections) and visualize the network, compute centrality, etc. These tools are powerful for custom analyses and academic-style network research. However, they usually require more manual effort and technical expertise, and they don’t automatically integrate with enterprise apps – data has to be imported. They are great for one-time deep-dives or research purposes, whereas the dedicated ONA platforms mentioned earlier are more suited for ongoing, operational use within companies.
    

In all cases, the trend is that ONA tools are increasingly **integrated into the flow of work**. Rather than being a one-off consulting project, ONA is becoming a continuous analytic capability enabled by software. The integrations with Outlook, Gmail, Slack, Teams, etc. make it feasible to keep the network insights up to date and readily available. This means organizations can monitor their informal structure much like they monitor financial metrics – and quickly act on insights.

**Leveraging ONA for Strategic Advantage:** The information from ONA tools empowers leadership to take targeted actions for improvement. For example, if an ONA tool shows that a particular region or business unit is isolated from the rest of the company’s network, executives can intervene by setting up cross-unit collaborations or knowledge-sharing programs. If the data reveals certain employees are core to many teams (perhaps at risk of burnout), management can redistribute workloads or provide additional support. When planning a reorganization or merger, ONA highlights the existing relationship web, helping design new structures that preserve important connections and address weak links. Over time, by using ONA-enabled tools, organizations can **measure the impact of their interventions** (did communication across silos increase after we restructured? Are our “connectors” more engaged after recognizing them?). This creates a feedback loop for organizational development. Companies that embrace these tools gain a **strategic edge** by making the often hidden social dynamics explicit and manageable. They can build more agile, innovative, and collaborative cultures intentionally, rather than by accident. In a world where effective collaboration and knowledge flow are key to competitive advantage, ONA provides the insights to **optimize the human network** of the organization continually and strategically.
