Team Design
==========
Here’s a **resilient team structure** for three parallel ML workstreams, along with a **RACI matrix** to clarify roles. This setup minimizes attrition risk by ensuring knowledge redundancy and clear ownership.

### **Team Structure for 3 ML Workstreams**

_(Ideal for a mid-sized ML project, e.g., deploying a recommendation system, fraud detection, and NLP model simultaneously)_

#### **Team Size & Roles**

| Role | Count | Key Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ML Project Lead | 1 | Oversees all workstreams, aligns with stakeholders, ensures cross-team coordination. |
| Workstream Leads | 3 (1 per stream) | Owns delivery of their ML model (e.g., NLP, CV, RecSys). |
| ML Engineers | 6 (2 per stream) | Implements models, pipelines, and deployments. |
| Data Engineers | 2 | Manages data pipelines, ETL, and feature stores (shared across workstreams). |
| MLOps Engineer | 1-2 | Standardizes CI/CD, monitoring, and model serving. |
| Data Scientists | 3 (1 per stream) | Focuses on experimentation, metrics, and research. |
| QA/Validation Engineer | 1 | Tests model performance, edge cases, and drift. |
**Total:** ~12-15 people (scalable based on complexity).

#### **Design Principles for Attrition Resistance**

1.  **Cross-Stream Pairing**: Each ML Engineer shadows another workstream’s engineer monthly.
    
2.  **Shared MLOps**: Centralized tools reduce dependency on one person.
    
3.  **Documentation**: Each workstream maintains a "model card" (metrics, training data, owner backups).

| Task/Decision            | Project Lead | Workstream Lead | ML Engineers | Data Engineers | MLOps | Data Scientists | QA |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-------|-----------------|----|
| Model Architecture Design| C            | A               | R            | C              | C     | R               | I  |
| Data Pipeline Development| I            | C               | C            | R              | A     | I               | I  |
| Feature Engineering      | I            | A               | R            | R              | I     | R               | I  |
| Model Training           | I            | A               | R            | I              | I     | R               | I  |
| Model Deployment         | I            | C               | R            | I              | A     | C               | R  |
| Performance Validation   | I            | C               | I            | I              | I     | C               | A  |
| Stakeholder Updates      | A            | R               | I            | I              | I     | I               | I  |

**Key**:

*   **A (Accountable)**: Ultimate decision-maker (only 1 per task).
    
*   **R (Responsible)**: Does the work (can be multiple).
    
*   **C (Consulted)**: Provides input.
    
*   **I (Informed)**: Kept in the loop.
    

* * *

### **Attrition Mitigation Tactics**

1.  **For Workstream Leads**:
    
    *   Deputies (e.g., Senior ML Engineer) can step up.
        
    *   Quarterly "architecture review" with all leads to share knowledge.
        
2.  **For ML Engineers**:
    
    *   Pair programming on critical components (e.g., feature stores).
        
    *   Rotate engineers across workstreams every 6 months.
        
3.  **For MLOps**:
    
    *   Document infrastructure as code (Terraform, Kubernetes configs).
        

* * *

### **Example Scenario**

*   **If the NLP Workstream Lead leaves**:
    
    *   Deputy (Senior ML Engineer) takes over temporarily.
        
    *   Data Scientist from the team steps up on experimental design.
        
    *   Project Lead redistributes stakeholder communication.

| Critical Skill           | Primary Owner   | Backup 1    | Backup 2  |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| NLP Model Training       | Alice (NLP Lead)| Bob (ML Eng)| Carol (DS)|
| Feature Store Management | Dave (Data Eng) | Eve (MLOps) | -         |

### **Key Takeaways**

✅ **Small, cross-functional teams** reduce single points of failure.  
✅ **RACI clarifies ownership** so attrition doesn’t create chaos.  
✅ **Documentation + rotation** ensures knowledge isn’t siloed.
