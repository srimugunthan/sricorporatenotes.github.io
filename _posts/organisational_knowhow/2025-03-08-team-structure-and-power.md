# Team Strucutures and Power structures

Functional Structures: Siloed Authority
---------------------------------------

In functional models, power consolidates within departments (e.g., marketing, finance).
Procter & Gamble’s structure grants CMOs unilateral control over branding budgets, creating fiefdoms where mid-level managers lack cross-departmental influence

While this clarifies accountability, it risks stagnation; P&G’s 2024 restructuring aimed to dismantle these silos after innovation slowed

Matrix Structures: Dual Reporting Lines
---------------------------------------

Matrix organizations, like those at IBM, distribute power between project managers and functional heads.
A cloud services team lead might report to both the CTO (for technical guidance) and a regional VP (for client delivery targets). 
This dual-authority system balances expert and legitimate power but can trigger conflicts, as seen in IBM’s 2023 attrition spike when engineers faced competing priorities from matrixed bosses

Flat Hierarchies: Democratizing Influence
-----------------------------------------

Startups like Spotify adopt flat structures to diffuse power among autonomous “squads.” 
While this empowers junior developers through referent power (peer recognition), it complicates decision-making.
Spotify’s 2025 shift toward hybrid hierarchy—retaining squads but adding product councils—highlights the challenge of scaling flat models without reintroducing bureaucratic layers
