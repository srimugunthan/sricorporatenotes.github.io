when you are leading a small remote team, how to have influence over the project when your counterpart teams are remote and larger.

### **Embrace the "David vs. Goliath" Narrative (Subtly):** 
Instead of trying to match the resources of the larger teams, subtly position your small team as the agile, innovative underdog. Highlight your speed and flexibility as a key differentiator. When proposing ideas, frame them as "lean experiments" or "nimble solutions" that can be quickly tested and iterated upon, something the larger, more established teams might struggle with.
Instead of competing directly with larger teams, focus on becoming the "go-to" experts in a niche area of the project. This specialization builds credibility and influence, as larger teams may rely on your expertise for critical decisions

*   **Become the Go-To Expert:** Deepen your knowledge in a niche area (e.g., a specific technology, process, or customer insight) so larger teams rely on your input.
*   **Be the "First to Document:** – If you define processes, frameworks, or terminology first, larger teams will often default to adopting them rather than reinventing the wheel.
### **"Pilot Project" Leverage:** 
Volunteer your team to take on a small, seemingly less critical but potentially impactful "pilot project" or a challenging edge case that the larger teams might overlook or deem too risky. If you deliver exceptional results, you gain disproportionate credibility and leverage for future, larger initiatives.


### **Leverage Influencers:**
*   Identify decision-makers and informal leaders in larger teams and cultivate alliances with them.Proactively engage with members of the larger teams to build informal alliances. Offer insights or assistance that align with their goals, creating goodwill and positioning your team as collaborators rather than competitors
*   **Secure Executive Sponsorship**: If possible, get a senior leader to endorse your team’s role in critical projects.

*   **"Shadow Metrics" for Influence:** If the main project metrics don't fully capture the value your team is contributing, subtly track and present "shadow metrics" that highlight your impact in a different, but relevant, way.



### **Leverage Asynchronous Influence**

*   **Document Everything:** Use shared wikis (Notion, Confluence) or project trackers (Jira, Trello) to ensure your team’s work is visible.
    
*   **Write Persuasive Updates:** Summarize progress, blockers, and next steps in a structured format (e.g., bullet points, dashboards) to keep stakeholders aligned.
    
*   **Pre-Meeting Alignment:** Share key messages or proposals with decision-makers before meetings to secure buy-in early.
*   *Weaponize Asynchronous Communication*


*   **Stop waiting for meetings.** Instead:
    
    *   **Drop preemptive written briefs** (Slack/email) before discussions, framing the issue _your way_. People often default to the first coherent narrative they see.
        
    *   **Use "silent agendas"** – Before a big meeting, privately lobby 1-2 key players so they show up already aligned with you.
        
    *   **Bury controversial asks in boring docs** – Need approval? Embed it in a routine update where it’s harder to nitpick.

### **Create "Forced Dependencies"**

Larger teams ignore small teams unless they _need_ something from them. So:

*   **Own a critical piece of infrastructure, data, or approval** that bigger teams rely on. (Example: If you control the CI/CD pipeline, test environment, or customer feedback loop, they _have_ to engage.)
    
*   **Become the bridge between two big teams** – If Team A and Team B don’t talk much, position yourself as the translator. They’ll default to you for coordination.

### ** Use "Controlled Chaos" to Your Advantage
Let big teams hit snags (sometimes). If they ignore your warnings, let a small failure happen—then swoop in with a fix. They’ll listen next time.

Schedule meetings at odd hours – If decision-makers are in different time zones, sometimes holding a late-night/early-morning call filters out the bureaucracy and leaves only the people who actually get things done.

### **Trade Favors:**
Offer to help larger teams with their pain points in exchange for their support on your priorities.

###  **The "Scout vs. Soldier" Strategy**

Big teams are like soldiers—focused on their orders. Your small team can be the **scout**:

*   **Bring them intel they lack** (e.g., customer pain points, tech debt risks, or competitor moves).
    
*   **Frame your work as "exploratory"** to avoid territorial fights. Example: _"We’re just running a quick experiment—no resources needed!"_ → Later, it becomes essential.

### **The "No" Workaround**


Big teams love saying no. So:

*   **Ask for the minimum viable "yes."** Instead of "Can we do X?" ask "Can we try X for two weeks?"
    
*   **Use "pilot" or "beta" labels** – Temporary things become permanent if they work.

### **Reverse-Psychology Stakeholder Management**

### 

*   **Ask for "advice," not approval.** People love feeling smart. Instead of "Can we do X?" try "We’re thinking of X—what’s the biggest risk you see?" They’ll often greenlight just to avoid seeming obstructive.
    
*   **Let them "steal" your ideas** – Pitch something as a half-baked thought in a casual chat. If a big-team leader later presents it as their own? Fine—now it has their sponsorship.

*   ### **Play the Long Game with "Credit Laundering"**
what is credit laundering?

While traditional "credit laundering" focuses on cleaning illicit _funds_, the underlying principle of making something "dirty" appear "clean" could be extended. For instance, a company might engage in unethical or even illegal practices that generate profits. They might then use complex accounting methods, shell corporations, or offshore accounts to obscure the origin of these profits, making them appear as gains from legitimate business activities. This is more directly related to financial crime and money laundering through corporate structures.

*   **Give away credit strategically.** When your team does something great, publicly tie it to a bigger team’s goal: _"This aligns perfectly with \[Big Team’s\] initiative on X!"_ They’ll start seeing you as an ally, not competition.
    
*   **Let the loudest person in the room repeat your point.** If someone interrupts and paraphrases your idea, let them. The idea wins, and you avoid ego battles.
  
### **Stay Adaptable & Resilient**

*   **Pick Your Battles:** Focus on high-impact areas where your influence matters most.
    
*   **Stay Positive & Professional:** Even if your team is smaller, maintaining a constructive attitude earns respect.
    
*   **Celebrate Joint Wins:** Recognize contributions from larger teams to foster goodwill.


### **Important Caveats:**

*   **Read the Room:** These unconventional tactics require careful observation and adaptation to the specific context and personalities involved. What works in one situation might backfire in another.
*   **Build a Foundation First:** Don't jump straight to unconventional tactics without first establishing a base level of trust and credibility through reliable delivery and professional communication.
*   **Authenticity Matters:** Don't try to be someone you're not. Adapt these ideas to your team's natural strengths and your own leadership style.
*   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** Some of these tactics could be misinterpreted if not executed carefully. Be mindful of how your actions might be perceived.
