Team Design
==========
Here’s a **resilient team structure** for three parallel ML workstreams, along with a **RACI matrix** to clarify roles. This setup minimizes attrition risk by ensuring knowledge redundancy and clear ownership.

### **Team Structure for 3 ML Workstreams**

_(Ideal for a mid-sized ML project, e.g., deploying a recommendation system, fraud detection, and NLP model simultaneously)_

#### **Team Size & Roles**

| Role | Count | Key Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ML Project Lead | 1 | Oversees all workstreams, aligns with stakeholders, ensures cross-team coordination. |
| Workstream Leads | 3 (1 per stream) | Owns delivery of their ML model (e.g., NLP, CV, RecSys). |
| ML Engineers | 6 (2 per stream) | Implements models, pipelines, and deployments. |
| Data Engineers | 2 | Manages data pipelines, ETL, and feature stores (shared across workstreams). |
| MLOps Engineer | 1-2 | Standardizes CI/CD, monitoring, and model serving. |
| Data Scientists | 3 (1 per stream) | Focuses on experimentation, metrics, and research. |
| QA/Validation Engineer | 1 | Tests model performance, edge cases, and drift. |
**Total:** ~12-15 people (scalable based on complexity).

#### **Design Principles for Attrition Resistance**

1.  **Cross-Stream Pairing**: Each ML Engineer shadows another workstream’s engineer monthly.
    
2.  **Shared MLOps**: Centralized tools reduce dependency on one person.
    
3.  **Documentation**: Each workstream maintains a "model card" (metrics, training data, owner backups).
