Leverage in negotiations:
=========================

*   **Information **: Information is power. Being well-informed about all aspects of the negotiation—such as the needs, wants, strengths, and weaknesses of the other party—can significantly boost your leverage. Thorough research and preparation enable you to anticipate the other party's moves and prepare counterarguments.
    
*   **Timing**: Control the timing. If you can control the timing of the negotiations, you can create leverage. For example, if there’s no rush for you to conclude a deal, but the other party is under time pressure, your ability to delay gives you leverage.
    
*   **Alternatives**: Create Alterntives. Having strong alternatives to the proposed deal (often referred to as your BATNA—Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) enhances your leverage. If the other party knows you have good alternatives, they may be more willing to make concessions.
    
*   **Relationships**: Build Relationships. Establishing a good rapport with the other party can indirectly be a form of leverage. If they like and trust you, they may be more inclined to reach an agreement that is favorable to you.
    
*   **Expertise and Reputation**: Being recognized as an expert or having a strong reputation in your field can give you leverage. People are more likely to concede to those whom they believe possess greater knowledge or credibility.
    
*   **Dependency**: Capitalize on dependency. If the other party depends on what you provide—whether it's a service, product, or resource—you hold leverage. Understanding and, ethically, maximizing this dependency can strengthen your position.
    
*   **Emotional Control**: Keeping your emotions in check and remaining calm and collected during negotiations can provide leverage. If you’re not visibly desperate or too eager, you maintain an air of having other options.
    
*   **Communication**: Communicate value clearly. Make sure the other party understands the value of what you are offering. If they perceive your offer as valuable, your leverage increases.
