Where do Individual contributors end their career
=================================================

Normal scope for each level as an Individual contributor is as follows:
| Level | L# | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry-Level | L3 | Task |
| Mid-Level | L4 | Feature |
| Senior | L5 | Project |
| Staff | L6 | Product / System |
| Senior Staff | L7 | Product Group / Org |
| Principal | L8 | Company |
| Distinguished | L9 | Industry |

Here's a rough estimate of the percentage of people at each level after a 20-year career, assuming a pyramid-shaped distribution where higher levels are increasingly rare:

*   **L5 (Senior)**: ~30-40%  
    Many professionals plateau at this level, as it represents a strong individual contributor or team lead role.
    
*   **L6 (Staff)**: ~20-30%  
    This level requires broader impact and leadership, which fewer achieve.
    
*   **L7 (Senior Staff)**: ~10-15%  
    Significant influence across projects or orgs is needed, making this rarer.
    
*   **L8 (Principal)**: ~5-10%  
    Very few reach this level, as it demands industry-level expertise or org-wide leadership.
    
*   **L9 (Distinguished)**: ~1-3%  
    Extremely rare, reserved for those shaping the company or industry.
    

### Notes:

1.  **Assumptions**:
    
    *   The distribution assumes a healthy attrition rate (e.g., not everyone stays 20 years).
        
    *   Company growth and industry (e.g., tech vs. finance) can skew percentages.
        
    *   Some companies "cap" levels (e.g., L6 is the terminal level for many).
        
2.  **Scope Alignment**:
    
    *   Higher levels (L7+) align with "Product Group/Org" or "Company" scope in the image, implying fewer roles exist.

  **Rough Qualitative Tendencies After a 20-Year Career at a MAANG-like Company:**

Given the competitive and high-performing nature of these organizations, and the hierarchical structure where the number of roles typically decreases at higher levels:

*   **L8 (Principal):** A relatively small percentage would likely reach this level after 20 years. This level often signifies significant technical leadership, strategic impact across a large part of the company, and a strong track record of innovation. You might see something in the **low single digits (e.g., 2-5%)** of those who started around the L3/L4 level 20 years prior still at the company and having reached this stage.
*   **L7 (Senior Staff):** A larger percentage than L8, but still a minority. Reaching this level generally indicates deep expertise in a specific domain, the ability to lead significant product groups or organizational units, and a history of delivering impactful results. Perhaps in the **10-20% range** of the original cohort still present.
*   **L6 (Staff):** A more substantial portion would likely be at this level. This signifies strong technical skills, the ability to lead and deliver complex products or systems, and influence beyond their immediate team. Maybe in the **20-30% range**.
*   **L5 (Senior):** A significant percentage of those who have stayed with the company for 20 years and progressed would likely be at this level. It indicates a solid track record of delivering projects and contributing meaningfully to features. This could be in the **30-40% range or even higher**, as it's a level many experienced individual contributors operate at.

**Important Considerations:**

*   These are very rough guesses based on general industry knowledge and the typical pyramid structure of organizations. The actual percentages could vary significantly.
*   Many people who start at entry-level positions in MAANG companies may choose to specialize and remain highly effective individual contributors at levels like L5 or L6 without necessarily pursuing management or higher leadership roles.
*   Others may leave the company before 20 years for various reasons, including starting their own ventures or moving to other opportunities.
