Polical capital and social capital
====================================

**Political Capital** and **Social Capital** are two important concepts in political science, sociology, and economics that describe different forms of influence and relationships. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### **1\. Political Capital**

**Definition:** Political capital refers to the resources—such as trust, influence, reputation, and goodwill—that a leader, organization, or government accumulates to achieve political goals. It enables them to push policies, negotiate deals, and maintain power.

**Key Aspects:**

*   **Influence & Power:** The ability to persuade others (voters, lawmakers, interest groups) to support an agenda.
    
*   **Trust & Credibility:** Built through consistent actions, fulfilling promises, or public approval.
    
*   **Expendable Resource:** Can be "spent" (e.g., pushing controversial laws) or "depleted" (e.g., scandals, broken promises).
    
*   **Sources:** Election victories, public popularity, alliances, or successful policy implementations.
    

**Example:** A president with high approval ratings has more political capital to pass bold legislation.

### **2\. Social Capital**

**Definition:** Social capital refers to the networks, relationships, norms, and trust within a society or group that enable cooperation and collective action. It’s about the value embedded in social connections.

**Key Aspects:**

*   **Bonding vs. Bridging:**
    
    *   **Bonding Capital:** Strong ties within a close group (e.g., family, ethnic community).
        
    *   **Bridging Capital:** Weaker but broader connections across diverse groups (e.g., business networks, civic organizations).
        
*   **Trust & Reciprocity:** People are more likely to collaborate if they trust each other.
    
*   **Collective Benefit:** Improves economic efficiency, democracy, and community resilience.

  
| Aspect        | Political Capital                  | Social Capital                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focus         | Power & influence in politics      | Relationships & trust in society |
| Used By       | Politicians, governments           | Communities, organizations, individuals |
| Key Resource  | Public support, alliances          | Networks, norms, cooperation     |
| Depletion     | Lost via scandals or failures      | Eroded by distrust or isolation  |


### **Relationship Between Them**

*   Political leaders often rely on **social capital** (e.g., grassroots networks) to build **political capital**.
    
*   Strong **social capital** can lead to better governance, while weak social capital may hinder political effectiveness.
    

**Example:** A neighborhood with strong social capital organizes quickly to rebuild after a disaster.
