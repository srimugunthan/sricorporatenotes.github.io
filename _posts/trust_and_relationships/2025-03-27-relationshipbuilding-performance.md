Relationship building Performance goal 
=====================================

When a performance goal like "Develop strong relationships with key partners" is set, quantifying such a qualitative goal for appraisal purposes can indeed be challenging. However, there are several strategies you can use to make a strong case during your appraisal. Here’s how you might approach it:

1.  **Define Key Metrics**: Begin by defining what metrics or indicators can best represent strong relationships. These could include:
    
    *   **Number of meetings or interactions**: Track the frequency of meetings with key partners to demonstrate regular communication.
        
    *   **Survey or feedback scores**: Implement regular feedback loops with partners, using surveys to gauge their satisfaction and the quality of the relationship.
        
    *   **Project collaborations**: Document instances where collaboration with partners led to successful project outcomes.
        
2.  **Set Benchmarks**: Establish clear benchmarks at the start of the appraisal period. For example, aim to increase partner satisfaction scores by a certain percentage or increase the number of collaborative projects.
    
3.  **Gather Evidence**: Collect evidence throughout the appraisal period that supports your achievements. This might include:
    
    *   **Emails or communication logs**: Show the regularity and depth of your communications.
        
    *   **Testimonials or endorsements from partners**: Gather statements from partners that can attest to the strength and value of the relationship.
        
    *   **Reports on project successes**: Provide details on specific projects where strong partnerships were instrumental in achieving goals.
        
4.  **Demonstrate Impact**: Link your relationship-building efforts to tangible business outcomes. This could include:
    
    *   **Revenue impacts**: Show how partnerships have led to new business opportunities or revenue growth.
        
    *   **Innovation and problem-solving**: Highlight how collaborations with partners have resulted in innovative solutions or effective problem resolution.
        
5.  **Use Visuals**: During your appraisal meeting, use charts, graphs, and tables to visually present the data you've collected. This could include growth in partner engagement levels, improvement in feedback scores, or an increase in collaborative projects.
    
6.  **Self-assessment and Reflection**: Provide a self-assessment that reflects on the strategies you employed to strengthen partner relationships, what worked, what didn’t, and how you plan to build on this moving forward.
    

By taking these steps, you can effectively argue that you have met or exceeded your goal of developing strong relationships with key partners in a quantifiable way during your appraisal.
