Preparing for stress
====================

*   **Pressure reveals your true self:** When things get tough, your reactions show who you really are. It doesn't create weaknesses, it exposes them.
*   **Controlling emotions under pressure is a learned skill:** The most effective people have mastered the ability to think clearly and manage their emotions when stressed. This isn't an innate gift, but something built through practice.
*   **Self-awareness is the first step:** Understand your emotional triggers â€“ what situations make you feel overwhelmed or reactive?
*   **Practice in controlled environments:** Regularly push yourself outside your comfort zone with challenges to build resilience.
*   **Shift your mindset about pressure:** See it as an opportunity for growth and a sign that you are in a position of responsibility.
*   **Pausing before reacting is crucial:** It allows you to choose a thoughtful response instead of an impulsive, emotional one that you might regret.
*   **Develop the habit of pausing:** Recognize your triggers, use physical cues to slow down (like deep breaths), and ask yourself what the best long-term response would be.
*   **Reframing situations changes your response:** See challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Ask better questions to shift your perspective.
*   **Your mindset shapes your results:** Choose to interpret events in a way that empowers you rather than overwhelms you.
*   **Breathing is a powerful tool to control stress:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system and restore clear thinking.
*   **Practice intentional breathing:** When feeling stressed, consciously slow down your inhales and make your exhales longer.
*   **Detaching from emotion allows for better decisions:** Recognize when emotions are clouding your judgment and choose to focus on the desired outcome.
*   **Label your feelings to create distance:** Instead of saying "I am angry," say "I feel anger."
*   **Focus on the bigger picture and long-term goals:** Make decisions based on what will get you the best results, not just on how you feel in the moment.
*   **Practice patience to avoid rushed decisions:** Give yourself time to let emotions settle before reacting.
*   **Preparation is key to excelling under pressure:** Don't rely on hope; train yourself beforehand for challenging situations.
*   **Identify your weaknesses and areas where you struggle under pressure.**
*   **Engage in controlled exposure to stressful situations to build resilience.**
*   **Use mental rehearsal to visualize yourself handling pressure effectively.**
*   **Develop recovery habits to manage stress and maintain a clear mind.**
*   **Embrace failure as a learning opportunity and part of the training process.**
*   **By training for pressure, you'll be ready to execute effectively when high-stakes moments arrive.**
